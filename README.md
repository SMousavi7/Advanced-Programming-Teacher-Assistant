I put the answer of questions that I have solved for students in Advanced programming class about threads. The questions that I have solved for them were:

1) *Producer-consumer*: One of the classic problems of computer science. Where there are some producers and consumers. Consumers don't consume unless there is something to consume and producers don't produce unless there is an empty spot for their product.
2) 
3) *bucket sort*: One of the sorts algorithms. In this algorithm we have some buckets that contain a specific range of numbers. We put the numbers in the original array in these buckets and then sort these buckets. And after that we print these buckets from low to high range.

4) *a simple example of a chat server using socket programming*

I hope it helps you in your programming journey.
